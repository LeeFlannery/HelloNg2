Angular 2/TypeScript Nerd-Off 2015-08

Files from the five-minute Angular 2 preview quickstart.
Instructions:
[https://angular.io/docs/js/latest/quickstart.html](https://angular.io/docs/js/latest/quickstart.html).

Follow all of the command line instructions from the quickstart. This repo holds the two completed files the quickstart has you build, index.html and app.ts.

##Protips

If your sandbox doesn't work after following the quickstart:

### You may be using the wrong version of TypeScript.

(Windows) At a command prompt type:

    tsc -v

You should be seeing version 1.5.0 or above. If not, you may have an older version of TypeScript in your path. Type this:

    where tsc

You should see tsc in your npm folder (e.g. c:\Users\You\AppData\Roaming\npm). If there is a version appearing above that, remove that path from your PATH variable.

(Mac)

  TODO but use
  
    which tsc
    
  instead of "where."
